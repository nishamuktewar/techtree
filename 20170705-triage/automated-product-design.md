# Automated Product Design / Personalization

This led me into some philosophical questions I still haven't sorted out. I think it is not ready for a report.

Theoretically it seems like if you know the goal of your product, and have a way to measure whether that goal is successful you should be able to 'train' a product. It seems like a place where you should be able to do this is with sales websites. But I get confused there about the separation between a/b testing and machine learning. And how templates figure into this.

Sepand: I also found a few plausabile use cases like A/B testing (in the broad sense; optimizing some page parameters based on a concrete metric) and simple things like matching page color pallete and balance with images (thegrid.io) but I think one major obstecle here is maintainablity because autamaticaly generated code is hard to maintain.

More to be written...
