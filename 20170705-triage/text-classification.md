## Text Classification

Given the number of approaches to (and applications of) text classification, there would be plenty to include in a report on the topic. Text classification is can be framed as a regression problem, but a large number of methods for text classification have been published that go beyond that approach.

The applications of text classification are similarly broad:
- sentiment analysis
- document organization and retrieval
- email classification and spam filtering
- assisted writing

Popular tools/toolkits:
- bag of words
- word2vec
- Mallet
- Weka
- LingPipe
