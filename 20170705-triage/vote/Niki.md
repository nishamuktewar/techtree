**text-classification with multi-task learning **: topic with broad applications, multi-tsak learning exploration and prototype possibilities
**survival analysis**: time to event predictions broad applications as churn/conversion rates, research is mature and many prototype possibilities

**+1**
**Multi-modal models / image to text **: interesting topic and applications with good prototype possibilities. Could be requiring extensive technical fine-tuning, beyond the scope of a FFL report
**GANs / deep generative networks**: Could be requiring extensive technical fine-tuning, beyond the scope of a FFL report

**0**
**learning to learn - interpreted as - AutoML** : this is a topic that is probably here to stay, too broad/fragmented tools for a coherent report
**Assisted writing** : extremely interesting but perhaps not broad enough commercial applications

**-1/-2**
**asynchronous stochastic gradient descent as building block of federated learning**: scope too wide/data issues
**N-short learning / transfer learning **	: very interesting field, unclear what a prototype would look like, might be premature topic
**automatic query reformulation / natural language query writing **: scope too narrow, unclear what a prototype would look like
**learning to learn - interpreted as - meta-learning for NN architecture **:  interesting optimization approach with broad (too broad) applications. Hard to make it a focused report topic?
