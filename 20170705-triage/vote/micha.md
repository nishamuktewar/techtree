+2, interesting for us and clients, clear prototype
 - text-classification with multi-task learning + assisted writing

+1, overly technical worried about prototype
 - GANs / Adversarial models
 - N-shot learning / transfer learning
 - asynchronous stochastic gradient descent as building block of federated learning

-1 overly technical, don't see the prototype
 - learning to learn - interpreted as - meta-learning for NN architecture
 - Multi-modal models

-2 mature and commodified data science best practice at this point, also don't see the prototype
 - learning to learn - interpreted as - AutoML
 - automatic query reformulation / natural language query writing

-2 not a FFL report, too basic
 - Survival analysis
