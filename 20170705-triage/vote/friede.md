+2

 - text-classification with multi-task learning

+1

 - GANs / deep generative networks, but only with a focus on using adversarial training or the latent representation of input space, not with a focus on (image) generation (quality concerns)
 - Assisted writing
 - Multi-modal models - too much overlap with recommendation report currently in the works, especially when it comes to applications and prototypes

0

 - N-short learning / transfer learning - interesting topic, undoubedtly useful, but prototype a concern
 - learning to learn - interpreted as - meta-learning for NN architecture - currently too technical, prototype a concern

-1 

 - Survivial analysis - too narrow, algorithmic innovation to incremental to support an entire FFL report
 - asynchronous stochastic gradient descent as building block of federated learning

-2

 - automatic query reformulation / natural language query writing - mature field
 - learning to learn - interpreted as - AutoML - too narrow, too application focused, no technical innovation
