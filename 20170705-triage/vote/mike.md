+2
 - Survival analysis (this is a vote for event prediction from time series data, e.g. https://ragulpr.github.io/2016/12/22/WTTE-RNN-Hackless-churn-modeling/, not traditional survival analysis)
 - text-classification with multi-task learning

+1, but worried about prototype
 - GANs / deep generative networks

0, too similar as a capability to NLG, algorithmic dev unclear
 - Assisted writing

0, interesting algorithmically but image to text seems of limited interest to clients
 - Multi-modal models / image to text

-1, don't see the prototype
 - N-shot learning / transfer learning
 - learning to learn - interpreted as - meta-learning for NN architecture

-1 i'd invest a lot of money in a company that is working on this problem, but it doesn't feel like a FFL report
 - asynchronous stochastic gradient descent as building block of federated learning

-1 has potential, but skeptical that there's successful recent algorithmic work to build off here
 - automatic query reformulation / natural language query writing

-2 mature and commodified data science best practice at this point, also don't see the prototype
 - learning to learn - interpreted as - AutoML
