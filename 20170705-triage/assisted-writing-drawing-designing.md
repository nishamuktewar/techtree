# Assisted Drawing / Writing / Designing

These are about harnessing the power of machine learning for assisting in creative tasks. A simple way to think about them is as fancy autocomplete functionality. Start drawing, writing, or designing something and the program suggests what you should do next.

A related but slightly different interface approach, would be to have the user first finish the work, then use something like style transfer to change the style of the drawing or the tone of the writing.

This would be a different kind of topic than we hve done, because it is super-focused on a capability. I don’t know if we would need to identify a specific algorithmic breakthrough to focus on with it. It seems like text is th most directly applicable to the clients we work with, though something visual might make for some splashy marketing. I think Samin’s ‘Assisted Writing’ piece, linked below, is very compelling and it would be interesting to think about what a report version of that could be.

- http://www.jon.gold/2016/06/declarative-design-tools/ experimental declarative design tool. It lets you ask for a series of permutations of the same design. This is a procedural generation tool. I am still thinking about how procedural/generative design relatives to ‘AI’ design. I think machine learning just opens up new methods of generation.
