Judging from the abandoned online tools and not very successful companies/products it seems Automatic Query Formulation has still
some challenges but Assisted Query Formulation or Query Expansion seems to be very promising.

Challenges for AQF:
 * Easily verfiable.
 * '... unlike search engines, users tend to express sophisticated query logics to an NLIDB and expect perfect results.' from [here](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2015/VLDB_Best_Paper.pdf)


#### Tools/Products:
* [quepy](https://github.com/machinalis/quepy) hasn't been updated in 7 months. [Demo](http://quepy.machinalis.com/)
* [Kueri](http://kueri.me/demo/) for salesforce

#### Papers: 
* [Word embeding for SQL](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3080000/3076251/a5-bordawekar.pdf?ip=24.193.94.109&id=3076251&acc=TRUSTED&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2EE47D41B086F0CDA3&CFID=783813067&CFTOKEN=92909602&__acm__=1500306106_c3b0665590fb9cc2f55886fbbed1a0b6)
