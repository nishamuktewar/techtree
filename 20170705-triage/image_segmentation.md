## Image segmentation

Negatives:

 - few of our clients use images, and this is a very specific capability within
   the image context, of likely limited direct and immediate use to almost all
   of our current clients. (cf. image recognition, which also acted as a
   "trojan horse" for us to introduce deep learning)

 - Not currently solved in ways I'd characterise as AI or ML, so outside our
   core focus, and doesn't allow us to introduce an ML capabiliy of generic
   interest.

Positive:

 - Technically very interesting

 - There's been a breakthrough in the last couple of years that has blown
   previous approaches out of the water: see
   http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yaojian/cvpr15.pdf, public implementation at
   https://bitbucket.org/mboben/spixel and benchmarks at
   https://github.com/davidstutz/superpixel-benchmark

 - Assuming you're interested in images, segmentation becomes more interesting
   as interpretability becomes more interesting
