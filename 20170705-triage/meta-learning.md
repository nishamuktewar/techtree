Algorithms and procedures to automatically learn the best neural network architecture for a task (e.g., [NEAT algorithm](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf)) or to construct/learn the best optimizer (e.g., http://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/assets/pdf/NIPS2016/Li_Malik.pdf).
