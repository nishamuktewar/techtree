# Causal Inference

- I wanted something to be happening here, but there doesn't seem to be any
  recent innovations
- Mainly used in clinical trials in terms of hypothesis testing
- Done as a series of tests on top of bayesian models
- Any report on this would be overly technical without too much to pin to
- Innovations in this field would definitely introduce new types of products,
  but the field isn't there yet.
