# How we choose research topics

1. Collect lots of ideas. Avoid self-censorship. Bad ideas are good ideas.

2. Meet to triage this list according to 5 criteria. Select ~1-2 topics per
   person for further investigation.

    1. Is it exciting to the team?
    2. Can it be framed as a strong capability (rather than an algorithm)
    3. Is it a subject that is more possible now than in two years, and likely
       to be more possible/transformative still in a couple of years. That
       usually means some or all of the following things are true:
        - There is excitement (ideally including concrete breakthroughs) in the
          research community
        - Economic constraints (e.g. hardware) have lessened/disappeared
        - There has there been a commoditization of tooling
        - Data is available (especially to FFL!)
    4. Is it useful to our existing clients?
    5. It is appealing to potential clients?
    6. It it possible to build a prototype?

3. Spend a couple of hours per topic Googling, thinking and further considering
   the topics with respect to the criteria above.

4. Meet again to further triage down to 2-3 topics total

5. Spend ~1 week doing detailed technical feasibility studies and brainstorming
   concrete prototype possibilities

6. Meet to settle on one topic. Profit.

At every stage, interesting subjects will not make the cut. Some should be put
back on the list for consideration next time! But many would make great [quick
projects](quick_projects.md) (e.g. they're not cutting edge but we should know
more to help our clients; or we need to spend more time on them before we
commit to a report).
