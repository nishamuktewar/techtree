# countering adversarial attacks

The idea is to spend 3-4 hours looking deeper. You should have in mind both the technical focus of a report, and the prototype.

## What is the technical focus of the report? 
### Are there one or perhaps two algorithms to hang the report on or to focus on in the prototype? 

Note: At this stage you probably won't have a chance to get them up and running or test them, but ideally you should have them in mind by the end of your deeper dive.


## What could the prototype be? 
We're not looking for a single definitive answer at this stage, but but a a few concrete ideas would be very useful. If these are hard to come up with, that may be evidence of a problem with the topic. We're looking for something that
- we can build in 2-4 months
- that feels like a useful/profitable product
- that exhibits the capability and the algorithmic innovations we're discussing
- and, if data is necessary, that data should be available and we should be able to share it with our clients

If a specific concern about your topic came up during our discussions, please be sure to dig into that. Please review the notes for your topic from the previous round and, if they were written by someone other than you, feel free to speak with the author to get their thoughts in more detail, or with anyone who had suggestions about a topic during our meetings.

Remember to document what you find. Negative results become great advice to clients, blog posts and newsletters!
