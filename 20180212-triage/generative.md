## What is generative adversarial networks (GANS)                                                    
GANS consists for 2 networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator produces a sample, and the discriminator determines if the sample is real or fake(generated by the generator). The discriminator is discarded once the generator has been trained.

Uses Jenson-Shanoon divergence as a distance metric for comparing the training distribution to the generated distribution. GANs are sometimes hard to train due to [convergence issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04862). New architectures and training procedures have been proposed to help with [training GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf). In addition, GANs only work with continous data since they require the composition of the generator and discriminator to be fully differentiable.

This is an algorithm for training GANS with discrete data.

Users earth mover's distance instead. This has been shown to be more stable with better performance in practice.
