Basic intro to difference between standard statistical inference and causal inference, where underlying data changes (http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jsm-july2012-pdf.pdf), room to articulate how the key concpets are different than other inference problems, importance of counterfactual reasoning
See as a question of - can we find areas of invariance in our equations if we change some conditions? 

Samantha Kleinberg book O'Reilly sent us last year - "Why?" - variation over time or variation wihtin samples - need to measure all shared causes of relationships between variables - confidence proprotional to confidence that there does not exist an unmeasured cause - inference aim to find relationships between variables - 

http://www.nasonline.org/programs/sackler-colloquia/documents/athey.pdf - again mention counterfactuals ("what would happen if we change a policy?") - existing techniques in ML do not directly apply to problem of estimating causal parameters;
