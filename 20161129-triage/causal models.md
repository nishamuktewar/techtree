Interesting questions about how you have to tweak algorithms/approach to inference/relationships between variables. 

Relevant to market given power of knowing if X causes Y, and modifications they can make to X to drive a given output/behavior.

Interesting questions to look into with team.

Unclear whether meets criteria of something that will be more possible in the next few years - not seeing much about commoditificaiton of tooling.

Decent amount of papers from November 2016 on arxiv, various approaches from different research groups.

The "do" operator shows up a lot: http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/talks/imperial_causality.pdf.

Basic intro to difference between standard statistical inference and causal inference, where underlying data changes (http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jsm-july2012-pdf.pdf), room to articulate how the key concpets are different than other inference problems, importance of counterfactual reasoning
See as a question of - can we find areas of invariance in our equations if we change some conditions? 

Samantha Kleinberg book O'Reilly sent us last year - "Why?" - variation over time or variation wihtin samples - need to measure all shared causes of relationships between variables - confidence proprotional to confidence that there does not exist an unmeasured cause - inference aim to find relationships between variables - 

http://www.nasonline.org/programs/sackler-colloquia/documents/athey.pdf - again mention counterfactuals ("what would happen if we change a policy?") - existing techniques in ML do not directly apply to problem of estimating causal parameters;
