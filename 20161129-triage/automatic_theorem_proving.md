ATP systems are computer programs that show that some statement (the
conjecture) is a logical consequence of a set of other statements (the axioms
and hypotheses). (http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/OverviewOfATP.html is a good
but outdated introduction to ATP systems); ATP systems engage in deductive
reasoning. To date, ATP systems are applied in mathematics (there have been
notable successes), software creation (e.g. NASA Amphion Project -
https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/rse/synthesis-projects-applications/pro-amphion/)
and software/hardware verification. There is at least one commercial company (a
consultancy http://www.eschertech.com/), their last release was in 2014. There
are plenty academic packages like E (http://wwwlehre.dhbw-
stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/Download.html) which is in active development.

What is exciting about ATP systems is that they may enable a different kind of
intelligence in machines, deductive reasoning, and certain answers. There are
attempts to combine ATP systems with deep learning, e.g., to select premises (a
bottleneck in the application of ATP systems -
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04442.pdf). I know that Google just started a new
research group on ATP systems and deep learning (a friend of mine joined the
group), my hunch is that it has they plan to develop new NLP tools. Current
approaches mine big data and study relationships a la "You will know a word by
the company it keeps." Imagine we could supplement these systems with deductive
reasoning systems, that would be powerful (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08359). I
would need more time to fully explore the potential of ATP for NLP but I feel
that's where it's going (e.g. automated knowledge base creating, better
question answering, need for less training data, etc.)

Verdict: super, super exciting but probably too early for us.
