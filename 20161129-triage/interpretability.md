Ton of academic excitement and some concrete new alogorithmic breakthroughs, e.g. LIME, BRLs

Commercially relevant to our existing clients who work in regulated
environments (finance, healthcare)

I worry it might seem a little dull/worthy to potential clients

~4 month prototypes exist, e.g.
 - add LIME to Pictograph
 - apply LIME to a text classification system (e.g. sentiment analysis)
 - aplly BRLs to the lending club data

Thumbs up for me as a 4 month project
