Machine Learning for Authentication

Themes
- non-Boolean auth, scalar certainty
- time sensitive
- Auth consumers can have varying levels of necessary auth - games may be lower than banking
- ML used to model user behavior or metadata

As a research topic
- No obvious breakthroughs
- Broadly applicable
- Exciting, easy to explain
- issue: transparency

- authentication is a user classification problem
- passwords may be a part of an authentication scheme alongside other classifiers
- banks already accept that auth isn't binary

User behavioral - Shi 2010
- auth is considered to have freshness, with time degrading certainty
- in-pattern behaviors boost auth certainty
- ML used to model patterns
- password as fallback where auth is below needed certainty
