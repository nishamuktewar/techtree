Recommendations algorithms are interesting for a few reasons. First, people tend to think it's a solved problem (collaborative filtering), but that approach rarely works in the real world due to the cold start problems and quirks of the types of data. It also doesn't naturally allow for realtime recommendations.

Over the last year there's been significant work in combining deep learning approaches to classification with recommendation.
