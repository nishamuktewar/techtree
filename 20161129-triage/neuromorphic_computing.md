Neuromorphic computing describes systems that mimic neuro-biological
architectures present in the nervous system, it can and has been applied to
software and hardware systems. A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is
understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications,
and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how
information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates
learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates
evolutionary change.
