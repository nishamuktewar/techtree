This topic was inspired by https://www.semanticscholar.org/ and
http://academic.research.microsoft.com/.

These are academic literature search engines that claim to do more than just
keyword search and basic citation search, i.e. understand the "intent" behind
the search using "AI".

Search is a generic problem faced by most of our clients and many of our
potential clients (e.g. Slack). So my impression is our clients would be
interested in developments.

But digging a little deeper, these two products basically seems to be a lot of
clever but academic literature-specific hand-coded rules, rather than any
fundamental algorithmic innovations. To that extent, it's probably not a good
report topic. The rules include citation-web-specific graph stuff and figure
parsing.

Also search more generally is a _huge_, mature hairball of a subject that I
personally don't feel particularly confident diving into.

That said, we should keep an eye out!
