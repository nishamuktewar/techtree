# Ambient Data Visualization

Ambient data visualization is a way of displaying data where you're not actively interacting with it all the time â€“ where it is a part of the environment. It could be certain sounds or changes in lights for example. It's a very cool idea that hasn't resulted in really any successful products that I know of. I think there will be more experimentation and possible uses as the cost of screens and the units needed to power visualizations come down in cost.

I think unless we start to see strong indications (like even one successful product) that it will be more popular than it should not be a report. We should experiment around the office with it though.

One weird example is that on the NPR show Marketplace when they do the market recap and the market has gone up they play "We're in the Money" in the background and when it has gone down they play a sad song (can't remember which).

Philosophically it's a pretty interesting topic. The idea behind it is often that we should take advantage of the brain's ability to process info without us consciously thinking about it. So you can replace certain active, draining interactions with passive awareness. But, again, I don't have great examples of people finding it really successful and useful.

If you want to get into kind of trippy territory, you can think of the sun's progress through the sky as an ambient data visualization of time. An analog clock is also kind of an ambient data visualization looked at a certain way.
