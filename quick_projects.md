# Quick projects :tada:

This is a list of hopefully quick projects that satisfy some or all of the
criteria below:

 - They would make good blog posts
 - Making progress on them would potentially point the way to a future full
   report
 - They would give FFL expertise in useful skills/tools to share with/help our
   clients
 - They allow us to write about things that probably wouldn't work as reports
   because they don't lend themselves to prototypes/products, or they are a
   cool but very specialized use case

Please add to this list! Please research and write about things on this list!

## Internal projects

 - Use client portal log data to see which reports get the most attention, whether we can cluster clients by the reports they like, or anything else useful.
