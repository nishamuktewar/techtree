# Quick projects :tada:

This is a list of hopefully quick projects that satisfy some or all of the
criteria below:

 - They would make good blog posts
 - Making progress on them would potentially point the way to a future full
   report
 - They would give FFL expertise in useful skills/tools to share with/help our
   clients
 - They allow us to write about things that probably wouldn't work as reports
   because they don't lend themselves to prototypes/products, or they are a
   cool but very specialized use case

Please add to this list! Please research and write about things on this list!

## Big topics and the future

 - FPGAs
 - Automatic theorem proving
 - Neuromorphic computing
 - Causal reasoning
 - Learning to learn

## Reporting on research, new machine intelligence products or our quick proofs of concept

 - distant supervision (e.g. http://deepdive.stanford.edu/distant_supervision)
 - New database paradigms, e.g. SIEUFERD, BayesDB
 - Speech recognition/generation/from video
 - Gaussian processes (subset of bigger time series forecasting problem)
 - Change point detection (subset/special case of bigger anomaly detection
   problem)
 - Sparse pointer models
 - GloVe [site](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/),
   [http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf](paper)
 - Recommendation and personalization --- what's new?
   [e.g.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/generating-recommendations-at-amazon-scale-with-apache-spark-and-amazon-dsstne/)
 - ML for authentication [notes](/20161129-triage/authentication_with_ml.md)
 - Automatic portfolio management
 - Stylometry
 - Transfer learning
 - Differential privacy
 - Autoforge: forge someone's voice using small example
 - Synthetic data generation
 - Fact checking

## Data science/ML best practices and fundamentals

 - Property-based testing (Hypothesis, Quickcheck, etc.)
 - Tools for data cleaning and working with missing/corrupted data --- what's
   new?
 - Data provenance and reproducibility
 - Survival analysis
 - (randomized) weighted majority algorithms

## Visualization

 - t-SNE for CEOs
 - Visualizing decision trees (see this [cry for
   help](https://twitter.com/amuellerml/status/801146947713306629))

## Ecosystems, infrastructure

 - Deep learning: Keras, tensorflow, MXnet/AWS etc.
 - Containers: Docker, rkt, kubernetes, etc.
 - Streaming projects
   [e.g.](http://xyz.insightdataengineering.com/blog/pipeline_map.html)
 - Time series databases: influxdb, kdb+, iobeam, arctic, kerf, kairosdb,
   opentsdb, etc.)
 - Serverless, Lambda vs. AppEngine for data products and map reduce
