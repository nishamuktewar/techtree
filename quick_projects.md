# Quick projects :tada:

This is a list of hopefully quick projects that satisfy some or all of the
criteria below:

 - They would make good blog posts
 - Making progress on them would potentially point the way to a future full
   report
 - They would give FFL expertise in useful skills/tools to share with/help our
   clients
 - They allow us to write about things that probably wouldn't work as reports
   because they don't lend themselves to prototypes/products, or they are a
   cool but very specialized use case

Please add to this list! Please research and write about things on this list!

 - t-SNE for CEOs
 - Visualizing decision trees (see this [cry for
   help](https://twitter.com/amuellerml/status/801146947713306629))
