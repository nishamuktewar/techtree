Apps that connect physical experiences with pre-set, digital payments
New Models for Apps Connecting Physical Experiences with Transactions

Structure: 

__What is this model and how does it work (e.g. underlying payment technology, maybe security talks)__

Physical experiences are increasingly being supplemented by digital payment methods on mobile phones, where the user enters payment information once and does not need to think about re-authorizing in the future. Uber saw explosive growth in use of its car services after moving to seamless payments with Braintree, which allowed users to pay in their own currencies. Starbucks designed an app to process payments that logistically takes longer to complete at the register, yet keeps users engaged and happily spending. [condense] PS Dept on the iPhone connects users with personal shoppers at major luxury fashion stores, with in-app payments that mean the user never has to leave the app environment to access merchandise exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores, opening up a world of options for brick-and-mortar stores and sales experts to move inventory. Even regional salad chain Sweetgreen has a mobile app that includes payment and pickup options at its locations.  

Payment options like Braintree, Square, [Stripe, WePay, Circle (bitcoin)....] [when did they come out?] [what's so special about their technology?] [what kind of encryption are they using?] [why weren't mobile payments happening before?] [what does this mean for consumer behavior data?]

> "For example, Braintree's mobile library uses __client side encryption__ written in a __mobile language__, making it __dramatically faster than libraries that are written for typical web pages.__ This __encryption was actually built into the Uber app__, allowing it to handle credit card data securely and quickly. With Braintree's approach, the customer who enters credit card information into the app is the last person to see it."

__Where is it increasing in popularity (so far, looks like luxury living-focused, concentrated at the coasts)__

So far, it looks likes these payments are going to the service industry: private cars, cafes, restaurants, shopping,... Is there a time where this will begin to saturate other markets? 

_Are there any industry examples (e.g. manufacturing? science? thinking of parts ordering startups)_
* Auto Parts Warehouse
* Prevost (motorcoach parts)
* Interspare (textile machinery) - submits photos of the parts/machines at issue; doesn't allow automatic payment, but these aren't coffee--they're big expensive industrial machines, and they believe it's better to have the vendor's internal experts assess the necessary parts than have the customer order them directly.
* Siemens HVAC
 
[Amazon One-click analogy.]

Where will this go next?

Blindspots:
* Statistics on smart phone adoption & data plans & location that drains battery 
* Security pitfalls (will users start to shy away? are people deactivating after Uber and Venmo scares?) 
	* Stripe doesn't send card information to intermediary servers
	* PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - required by the major cards (and by law in some US states)
	
* Stripe seems to have the best, easiest API


Brainstorm:

Uber uses Braintree (acquired Card.io) 
PS Dept uses []
Magic 
Cover - 
Starbucks [Gift cards. Paypal. Bar codes.]
Beautified
Sweetgreen
Chop't (?)
Lyft uses Stripe - http://www.lyft.com/terms

Sorta:

Seamless/Grubhub
Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Papa Johns?
Google Wallet
Spring (no physical experience)
Jukely (subscription model for partying)
Shyp (local shipping, paid through app)

Powered by:
Stripe
Square Cash (?) 
Venmo
Paypal 
Braintree
Apple Pay? RFID? Beacons?

Random side thoughts: 
(Snapchat has cash now!)
(Instagram - what's up with their in-app purchases?)

PS Dept lets iPhone shoppers text stylists in major stores, free shipping, free returns. There is no e-commerce aspect -- it's directly based on bricks & mortar inventory, pushed into m-commerce. Any savvy shopper knows major department stores rarely match their extensive in-store inventory with online interfaces. But the true physical experience here? Store associates, using in-store payments to augment their consumer interactions.
