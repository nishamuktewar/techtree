Apps that connect physical experiences with pre-set, digital payments

Structure: 
What is this model and how does it work (e.g. underlying payment technology, maybe security talkes)
Where is it increasing in popularity (so far, looks like luxury living-focused, concentrated at the coasts)
Are there any industry examples (e.g. manufacturing? science? thinking of parts ordering startups)
Where will this go next?

Brainstorm:

Uber
PS Dept
Magic
Cover
Shyp
Starbucks
Beautified
Sweetgreen
Chop't (?) 

Sorta:

Seamless/Grubhub
Spring (no physical experience)
Jukely (subscription model for partying)

Powered by:
Stripe
Square Cash (?) 
Venmo
Paypal 
Apple Pay? RFID? Beacons?

Random side thoughts: 
(Snapchat has cash now!)
(Instagram - what's up with their in-app purchases?)
