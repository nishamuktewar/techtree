* implement audio segmentation (ie: given audio of a conversation, identify

* emotion analysis in audio

* detect qualities of a person (age, gender, race, income, email domain) from
  audio

* detect qualities of a person from image data

* attempt a recommended agenda by going through e-mails and doing some content

* evaluate speech to text libraries

* can we use google's voice2text on android to make an interface to always show
  relevant information for the current conversation

* create generative algorithm for voice so that we can model people's voice (can
  use a physics model of the voice box? superposition from a large library of
  base voice sounds?)

* text summarization.

* corpus summarization

* story generation (templates using tv trops? RNN/LSTM? language model?).. robot
  dungeon master 

* never ending chose your own adventure book (ie: generate story, when
  confidence in content is low, prompt user for input)

* automatic landscape/building generation in games (voxels?)

* translate from different vernaculars, jargons or personal colloquialisms into
  another

* infer population density from landsat data
