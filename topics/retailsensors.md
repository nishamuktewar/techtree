What's up with: Sensors in Retail -

+ Picture-perfect inventory data science at Zara, who has a history of investing in smart operations research.
A system for reusable RFID chips to automatically place inventory order
Compare to previous Zara/MIT paper about how to optimize shipping from warehouse to store
Does something with less overhead affect retail stores? 

+ Visual analytics in stores from CCTV 
Spatial analytics: where do people like to shop in your store (over-reliance: if every part is optimized, won't there always be a losing display?)
Size analytics: what size are my shoppers? (how are data teams distinguishing actual shoppers from accompanying shoppers?)
Heat maps at malls

+ Virtual bodies
Alvanon and Body Labs do this for fashion. Build on a long history of scanner research.
Dive into the papers! 
Kinect, sense, etc lower the barrier to entry
Body labs based on algorithms originally designed for animation. (what are the racial demographics of their "average" body?)
What are the privacy issues? 
Open source versions?
The startup that pulls out garment sizes from smart photography? Are there CV algorithms that can alread estimate this well? 
If your size doesn't exist, smarter data won't help you
Virual mirrors in physical space
Size recommendations: how to fill sparse matrices? How will this balance out for size/fit preference, brand knowledge, or single accounts who buy for multiple users? 
Shoes have quality issues that go beyond fit and have more to do with design
What does Loop Commerce mean for the multi-user account problem? 

+ Virtual bodies: Accessories
What does it mean for companies like Sols to come up? Use machine learning to retrofit an iPad to make smart scans of feet. 
Mixes additive manufacturing with other manufacturing to get cheap custom soles to retrofit existing shoes
Eventually will make their own shoes (has a weird prototype. see also Nike FlyKnit for production innovation)
