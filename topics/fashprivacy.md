Fashion + Sensors in retail.

Retail stores in the fashion industry are adding new capablities to existing store technology through advances in machine learning research. Pre-existing sensors, from security cameras (CCTV) to RFID tags, are getting adapted to create richer datasets from which retailers can automate some business decisions.

The same type of visual analytics that go into crowd data analysis from satellite imagery can be applied to CCTV feeds to get a sense of how store architecture and displays affects traffic patterns of customers.

For one, visual merchandisers create compelling displays of new arrivals on a periodic schedule. For multi-brand stores, part of what gets displayed prominently is determined by advertising and promotion dollars. Movement analytics gives further justification of where precisely to place featured items, based on how customers tend to interact the layout of a specific store. Before a retail store is constructed, architects and interior architects can test layouts in virtual reality devices, collecting data on where users focus their attention in a virtual walkthrough. Companies like IrisVR are working to make this as seamless as possible on the back end. 

Another use case is for stores to derive “metadata” for specific customers. “Real-time clothing recognition in surveillance videos” from Yang & Yu proposed a method for video-based detection of clothing for retail CCTV in 2011. Their approach is to apply segmentation to video images of clothing, finding a computationally inexpensive method that works with fixed and moving cameras. It starts with facial detection to recognize a human in the footage, finds the least occluded image, estimates human pose, recognizes dominant pixels as skin tones, detects the foreground, segments clothing and classifies into eight pre-set categories. Based on research from eBay Research in 2014, improved results could come from using clothing detection (identifying objects of interest within a bounding box) instead of segmentation (finding classifications for all pixels per image).

That’s not all that happens in retail surveillance. With increasingly cheap depth sensors like the Kinect, CCTV feeds can be fit with software that finds a human, estimates their pose (likely based on the locations of joints), and calculates their body measurements. Because clothing is often produced weeks to months in advance of shipping, this affects not only the ability to choose which warehouse sizes are sent to which stores, but to determine the measurements of those sizes anew based on consumer foot traffic. This is already happening within the industry for companies like Alvanon, blah, blah. 

Not limited to CCTV, this type of profiling technology also works on static images obtained by smart mirrors, a new type of touch interface for users to request items from fitting rooms at stores like Rebecca Minkoff in New York City. In comparison, is much easier to process a single-person static image.

This starts to sound like the metrics familiar to ecommerce, with even richer consumer profiles. Stores can build automated recommender systems based on in-stock items that the customer can try immediately. The missing piece is automated inventory management, to ensure the right pieces make it to the right zip codes in the first place. Most stores still manually request new styles and physically count what items they have in stock. Zara, which dedicates sustained efforts to get as perfect of a data picture as possible (MIT, BOF), found a way to adapt RFID chips not to interfere with security tags, and wave RFID wants to get highly accurate information about inventory in minutes instead of hours (REF). With more stores adopting systems that can automate inventory notifications, rather than succumbing to manual counting or taking associates off the selling floor to search for items, customer satisfcation can improve significanly. This can also trigger events like automatic replenishment of popular styles from the warehouse, instead of asking associates to wager with a buyer for more of certain items.

Some analytics companies choose to anonymize personally identifyable data, while others make no such mention. There is no precedent to sign a Terms & Agreements clause for walking into a store, which may be tracking your cell phone the minute you walk into a shopping center. Whether or not you’re connected, if a smart phone’s wifi is turned on, its profile of past networks can be easily determined by routers (REF S.Mattu). Even with a scrambled MAC address identifier (REF), how many people do you expect have your home, work, and local cafe’s wifi network stored on their mobile device? While coverage of these types of technologies briefly mention “privacy concerns”, there is little futher prodding into what is meant by privacy in this case; whether those concerns should be felt by stores or consumers; and whether consumers have any reaction once they realize what is happening.

To establish a threshhold for whether retailers should re-think how emerging technologies affect privacy, we use a model developed by Kevin Bankston & Ashkan Soultani in the Yale Law Journal. They claim, 
“If the cost of the surveillance using the new technique is an order of magnitude (ten times) less than the cost of the surveillance without using the new technique, then the new technique violates a reasonable expectation of privacy”. 

How much would it cost to manually track a customer? Let’s take a luxury retail store where associates makes roughly $30,000/year. They often have a client book, along with the ability to use customer profiles to pull up purchase history, especially when a loyalty card program is in place. Assuming the associate spends an average of 5 minutes per customer during their workday, they can track the outfits, behaviors and preferences for 96 customers per day, or $1.20-$1.25 per customer. Even considering commission-based sales of $3000/day on 1% commission only raises that number to $1.50-1.58 per customer.
