Data in fashion for style recommenders.

Fashion-exclusive companies: 
Barneys - Has worked with Proclivity in the past
Saks - Has worked with Proclivity in the past
Lyst - Teeming with data scientists
Net-A-Porter - Uses stylists
PS Department - Uses tech to link existing stylists/store associates with potential clients

Companies with fashion/e-commerce recommenders:
Wanelo (N/A)
Fancy (still relevant?)
Want
Nuji (potentially open?)
Polyvore
Netflix (potentially open?) http://www.wired.com/2013/08/qq_netflix-algorithm/
Amazon
Etsy (open) https://codeascraft.com/2014/11/17/personalized-recommendations-at-etsy/
Gilt (relatively open)
Ebay (search >> recommender)

Potential Problems or Points of Interest:
A/B Testing - is it the best way to judge?
Amazon Mechanical Turk example from @echen
http://www.quora.com/How-do-you-measure-and-test-the-quality-of-recommendation-engines/answer/Edwin-Chen-1

Are there standard ways to judge the effectiveness of the algos? 
Looping: For example, the Gilt algo will eventually run out of products. E.g. How many clicks before you run out of products? 
Idea of discovery 

Comparing & abstracting: 
Gilt - eventually cycles through the same six pairs of wide-leg pants & runs out of ideas
Gilt - doesn't remember whether you've clicked on this and vow to show something else
Gilt - not styled by hand, only algo answer. does not show other outfit pieces
Gilt - non-existant or hidden social component 
Lyst - sometimes overly inclusive (more search engine than recommender) 
Lyst - first-page recommender is content curated by branding team
Lyst - very flexible for filtering out products when you have something very specific in mind
Lyst - combines visual similarity and category filtering 
Lyst - Usually has a new thing to click on without running into a closed-loop
Lyst - Documented as using: "Weighted Alternating Least Squares" & "Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets" 
** Read some papers on this
Wanelo - assumes you want to shop like other people (someone says this isn't true? Lyst?)
Polyvore - clustery
Etsy - TMI. How to adjust? Collapses a matrix cown
Barneys - Check how many clicks before a loop. Does have some overlap.

Future Possibilities, Improvements:
Approximate Bayesian Computation might be helpful for simulating recommendations based on a tiny number of clicks. 
Bloom filters (?) Hmm 
Tinder-like explicit feedback for product recommendations (why is this not happening?)

    Problems Raised. 
      Content filtering - creates a user or product profile - *expensive to gather & merge external information
      Collaborative filtering - identifies user-item associations, analyzes user relationships & item similarity
          *Cold start problem - What to do with a new product or new user? Content filtering is better. 
          Neighborhood method
          Latent factor models - discovers its own categories which may or may not be immediately apparent
            Matrix factorization - scale well, accurate predictions, flexible modeling options
             *Explicit feedback - difficult, most users only rate a small number of products.
             Implicit feedback - strength of matrix factorization.
              *Computing the mapping of each item and user to factor vectors q and p. Matching items to hidden factors
              SVD *must factor the user-item rating matrices
              *sparseness in rating matrix continuing problem
               *using only the known value causes overfitting
               *data imputation (older method) increases amt. data
               * model the observed only & avoid overfitting with regularized model.
