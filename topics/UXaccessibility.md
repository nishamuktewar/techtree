__What's up with: Accessibility and Design.__

**Intro paragraph:**

Design accessibility is not standard across the web.
Population health and age data can help set design standards and allow better access for untapped markets. The senior population is constantly stereotyped as uninterested in smart phones, but clearly adopt in products that work well for them, like tablets. [cite] Many find the available products (hardware and UX) non-accommodating. The problems that affect seniors transcend age group: visual impairment affects []% of the population. Smart phone text is simply too small with too little spacing between clickable links and buttons to be useful for many seniors who have been comfortable with smart phones for years. Older users are more impatient with non-accommodative UX and less likely to try many different solutions to get to a point of completion. [cite] 

There are beta sites that simulate how your images read to a person with different forms of colorblindness as a quick check, but with interactivity becoming standard, data visualizations that already allow the user to permute category labels could also be modified to allow the text to scale or the color palette to fit the visually impaired better. For interactive graphics built with tools like D3, it is relatively trivial to add a button to change to a colorblind-friendly palette, or allow the user to change the size of the text for ease of reading. 

Another consideration is text stored as an image. Outside of situations where a user might choose not to download images, this type of information should repeat the stored text in case a user needs compatibility with text to speech software. 

For some products, the premise of differentiation is seamless payments. If that is not a feature to your product Seniors also may carry a bias against entering credit card information on the web. Does your site have the ability to pay by phone or mail? How many users would need to request these features before the option was worthwhile? 



MIT has a cool lab that works on accessibility design for those in wheelchairs and with other special considerations. 



Lechal would allow for smart phone directions to be programmed in, then used for those who may not have hands free to continually check for directions (e.g. cane, walker). One of my favorites is the way Bengler thinks about this with Chorderoy, a tactile product concept that would allow users to type into wireless interfaces with one hand, without need for a keyboard, on-screen keyboard, or a flat surface to rest on. One project in Japan leveraged GPS and map data to create an interactive map of surfaces that might be difficult for the less mobile to transverse without 

__Web needs to take into account various user biases:__

* Color blindness (text distinction problems. blue green problems)
* Difficulty seeing (stats on vision across the states)
* Blindness
* Hands that shake 
* Speech to vision software - readable images, readable infographics
* Mouse difficulty (two-handed mouse use, need big distances between)
* Touch or stylus preference
* Keyboard shortcuts. 

__Features to incorporate: __

* Adjustable text size
* Distances between form items
* Subtitles (check out the automatic subtitle startups) 
* Touch is better than mice
* Touch screen optimization (favor tablets)

__Physical Space__

* Maps that show users where inaccessible barriers might be located
* Tactile input devices that open up smart phones, virtual reality, and other wireless interfaces without the difficulty of touch screens 
* Swype is a good example here (cite)
* Clothing that incorporate the specific needs of a modern person who may be in a wheelchair but still want to use an iPhone
* Non-invasive, passive sensors detached from the phone that allow users to interface with larger screens or custom setups if necessary (e.g. Softspot + an iPad app, Google glass with accessibility maps)
* Smart watches and devices that allow users to interface with phones in a handsfree manner (Ringly, Apple Watch, Pebble)
* Ergonomic keyboards
* Ergonomic mice
* Ergonomic chairs 
* Make walking around easier/faster/cheaper (Lechal. Sols)
