__What's up with: Accessibility and Design.__

**Intro paragraph:**
**define + explain topic**
**brief history of topic**

Technology has an unprecedented opportunity to be inclusive by tweaking digital and physical product design while keeping accessibility in mind. Web products are not created equal for those with vision impairments, unsteady hands, or other concerns that affect all age groups but especially seniors. Population health and age data can help product designers anticipate the physical limitations that may be the only thing standing between a user and a product. An excellent investigation of these issues was disseminated this year by Ollie Campbell in [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/05/designing-digital-technology-for-the-elderly/). The senior population is constantly stereotyped as _uninterested_ in smart phones, but may be reacting to the difficulties with vision or hand-eye coordination that make the small screens untenible. [cite] Parts of the aging population have already been smart phone users for years, and may be experiencing physical limitations for the first time. Seniors clearly adopt products that work well around these issues, like tablets, and also like to use social media, email, and shopping sites like users of any age. [cite] 

**new developments: already shipping interactive web-based reports - can add accessibility features (color, size)**
The problems that affect seniors transcend age group: visual impairment affects []% of the population. [cite] There are beta sites that simulate how your images read to a person with different forms of colorblindness as a quick check, but with interactivity becoming standard, data visualizations that already allow the user to permute category labels could also be modified to allow the text to scale or the color palette to fit the visually impaired better. For interactive graphics built with tools like D3.js, it is possible to add code to allow the user to change to a colorblind-friendly palette or larger text size. Another consideration is text stored as an image, as in infographics. Besides situations where users choose not to download images, it is important to repeat the text somewhere on the page so that text-to-speech software can be used. 

Older users are more impatient with non-accommodative UX and less likely to try many different solutions to get to a point of completion. Skeudomorphism, where items are depicted online as they look in real life, is not necessarily useful. However, clear distinction between text that can or can't be clicked is helpful, as is creating minimum distances between certain types of "buttons", and spelling out usage instructions where useful [cite]. While millennials and others might catch on quickly to interfaces that mirror familiar apps, seniors and anyone else should be able to defer back to a user manual spelling out how to get the most out of your products. In addition, simply adding instructions alongside wherever data input is required, as well as allowing keyboard-only interfaces can be a great help. Some seniors have printed instructions on how to use their favorite sites, so massive overhauls can make them feel marginalized and cause them to abandon their favorite web products. Written steps about what to expect when filling out forms can be helpful to any age (e.g. Kickstarter). Forcing users to select state names from drop down menus, for example, can cause unnecessary errors and increase the amount of time spent on the page, as switching to the mouse may be a mobility problem (requiring two hands to steady) or causes unnecessary complexity (where a user looks back and forth from the mouse to the screen) [cite]. Although it is important to control data input format, accommodating decades of habit of using () and - in phone numbers should not be a major technical problem. Forms that automatically move to the next line can also cause errors for all users. Users may now need to physically manipulate their way back to an earlier part of the form to correct an error, and I've seen more than enough forms change the order of the numbers I am typing in because of a lag in the automatic switching. [[Rephrase with a different tone: Have you ever filled in an online form that automatically jumped to the next line? Although using the "tab" key is an easy way to move forward, it's not clear that there is an equally intuitive way backward. Imagine if the only way you had to correct an eror required you to use two hands to move a mouse back to the earlier part of the form. How often would you want to repeat a transaction on the offending site?]] 

__Web needs to take into account various user biases:__

* Color blindness (text distinction problems. blue green problems)
* Difficulty seeing (stats on vision across the states)
* Blindness
* Hands that shake 
* Speech to vision software - readable images, readable infographics
* Mouse difficulty (two-handed mouse use, need big distances between)
* Touch or stylus preference
* Keyboard shortcuts. 

__Features to incorporate:__

* Adjustable text size
* Minimum distances between form items and links
* Colorblind-friendly link colors that differentiate visited links and in-line links
* Subtitles (check out the automatic subtitle startups) 
* Touch is better than mice
* Touch screen optimization (favor tablets)

For some products, the entire premise of differentiation is that payment information is stored seamlessly. If that is not central to your product, does your site have the ability to pay by phone or mail? How many users would need to request these features before the option was worthwhile? Seniors with a bias against storing card information in the computer -- or, possibly, who only operate via cash and check -- could be worthwhile to accommodate, especially since they tend to be more financially stable than the mobile commerce obsessed younger crowd.

In physical space, many emerging technologies could be of use for accessibility issues. MIT has a Open Style Lab which works on accessibility design for those in wheelchairs and with other special considerations.  Lechal's soles link with Google Maps and vibrate when the user needs to turn left or right. Smart phone directions could be programmed in, then used for those who may not have hands free to continually check for directions (e.g. cane, walker, injury, or assisting someone else). One research project in Japan leveraged GPS and map data to create an interactive map of barriers for those with mobility issues to avoid. Imagine this working together with vibrating sole technology. One of my favorites is the way Bengler thinks about this with Chorderoy, a hardwares product concept that would allow users to type into wireless interfaces with one hand, without need for a keyboard, on-screen keyboard, or a flat surface to rest on. Swype, which allows smooth scrolling over letters to enter text, is an excellent tool for those with difficulty accurately typing because the symbols are too close together. One Facebook commenter was shocked to learn there were watches and other technologies already available (e.g. Ringly, Pebble) which would allow her to receive customized, select notifications for emergencies from a sick relative without needing to look at her phone. 

__Physical Space__

* Maps that show users where inaccessible barriers might be located
* Tactile input devices that open up smart phones, virtual reality, and other wireless interfaces without the difficulty of touch screens 
* Swype is a good example here (cite)
* Clothing that incorporate the specific needs of a modern person who may be in a wheelchair but still want to use an iPhone
* Non-invasive, passive sensors detached from the phone that allow users to interface with larger screens or custom setups if necessary (e.g. Softspot + an iPad app, Google glass with accessibility maps)
* Smart watches and devices that allow users to interface with phones in a handsfree manner (Ringly, Apple Watch, Pebble)
* Ergonomic keyboards
* Ergonomic mice
* Ergonomic chairs 
* Make walking around easier/faster/cheaper (Lechal. Sols)
