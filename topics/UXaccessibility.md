__What's up with: Accessibility and Design.__

**Intro paragraph:**

Technology has an unprecedented opportunity to be inclusive by tweaking digital and physical product design while keeping accessibility in mind. Web products are not created equal for those with vision impairments, unsteady hands, or other concerns that affect all age groups but especially seniors. Population health and age data can help product designers anticipate the physical limitations that may be the only thing standing between a user and a product. An excellent investigation of these issues was disseminated this year by Ollie Campbell in [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/05/designing-digital-technology-for-the-elderly/). The senior population is constantly stereotyped as _uninterested_ in smart phones, but may be reacting to the difficulty of reading small text or being unable to select from menu items that are too close together. [cite] Parts of the aging population have already been smart phone users for years, and may be experiencing difficulties for the first time. Seniors clearly adopt products that work well for them, like tablets. [cite] 

The problems that affect seniors transcend age group: visual impairment affects []% of the population. [cite] There are beta sites that simulate how your images read to a person with different forms of colorblindness as a quick check, but with interactivity becoming standard, data visualizations that already allow the user to permute category labels could also be modified to allow the text to scale or the color palette to fit the visually impaired better. For interactive graphics built with tools like D3.js, it is possible to allow the user to change to a colorblind-friendly palette or larger text size. 

Another consideration is text stored as an image. Outside of situations where a user might choose not to download images, this type of information should repeat the stored text in case a user needs compatibility with text to speech software.

Older users are more impatient with non-accommodative UX and less likely to try many different solutions to get to a point of completion. Skeudomorphism, where items are depicted as they look in real life, is not necessarily useful. However, clear distinction between text that can or can't be clicked is helpful, as is creating minimum distances between certain types of "buttons" [cite].

__Web needs to take into account various user biases:__

* Color blindness (text distinction problems. blue green problems)
* Difficulty seeing (stats on vision across the states)
* Blindness
* Hands that shake 
* Speech to vision software - readable images, readable infographics
* Mouse difficulty (two-handed mouse use, need big distances between)
* Touch or stylus preference
* Keyboard shortcuts. 

__Features to incorporate: __

* Adjustable text size
* Distances between form items
* Subtitles (check out the automatic subtitle startups) 
* Touch is better than mice
* Touch screen optimization (favor tablets)

For some products, the entire premise of differentiation is that payment information is stored seamlessly. If that is not central to your product, does your site have the ability to pay by phone or mail? How many users would need to request these features before the option was worthwhile? Seniors with a bias against storing card information in the computer -- or, possibly, who only operate via cash and check -- could be worthwhile to accommodate, especially since they tend to be more financially stable than the m-commerce obsessed younger crowd.

In physical space, many emerging technologies could be of use for accessibility issues. MIT has a cool lab that works on accessibility design for those in wheelchairs and with other special considerations.  Lechal's soles link with Google Maps and vibrate when the user needs to turn left or right. Smart phone directions could be programmed in, then used for those who may not have hands free to continually check for directions (e.g. cane, walker, or assisting someone else). One research project in Japan leveraged GPS and map data to create an interactive map of barriers for those with mobility issues to avoid. One of my favorites is the way Bengler thinks about this with Chorderoy, a tactile product concept that would allow users to type into wireless interfaces with one hand, without need for a keyboard, on-screen keyboard, or a flat surface to rest on. Swype, which allows smooth scrolling over letters to enter text, is an excellent tool for those with difficulty accurately typing because the symbols are too close together. 

__Physical Space__

* Maps that show users where inaccessible barriers might be located
* Tactile input devices that open up smart phones, virtual reality, and other wireless interfaces without the difficulty of touch screens 
* Swype is a good example here (cite)
* Clothing that incorporate the specific needs of a modern person who may be in a wheelchair but still want to use an iPhone
* Non-invasive, passive sensors detached from the phone that allow users to interface with larger screens or custom setups if necessary (e.g. Softspot + an iPad app, Google glass with accessibility maps)
* Smart watches and devices that allow users to interface with phones in a handsfree manner (Ringly, Apple Watch, Pebble)
* Ergonomic keyboards
* Ergonomic mice
* Ergonomic chairs 
* Make walking around easier/faster/cheaper (Lechal. Sols)
