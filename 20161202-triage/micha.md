# 2016/2017 Research Preferences

NOTE: the lists aren't in any particular order

## Yes

### 8mo
- Differential privacy/overfitting and private data --- synthetic data
  generation
- One shot learning
- Automatic ML/parameter optimization
- Dynamic vocabs in NLP (fasttext)
- Conversational AI/bots --- question answering
- Time series/forecasting --- Gaussian processes / point process NN's
    - deep topic that could be 8mo or 4mo
- Source/fact credibility ranking --- fact-checking plugin
- Causal models and reasoning

### 4mo
- Anomaly detection
- Serverless products
- Interpretability (LIME, BRLs) and trust
- Time series/forecasting --- Gaussian processes
    - deep topic that could be 8mo or 4mo
- Provenance/reproducibility of data analysis

## Maybe
- Semi-supervised/adversarial learning --- embedding and autoencoders
    - I'd like to do this, but I still think we should be weary about another NN
      report unless it's something INCREDIBLY important. Generative NN's are
      really cool, but also still need time
- Reinforcement learning


## Blog
- Neuromorphic computing --- FPGAs
- Automatic theorem proving/program correctness --- property-based code testing
- Intuitive psychology/theory of mind (RL for coffee)
    - Still needs time...
- Source code repository analysis/sparse pointer models
- Recommendation
