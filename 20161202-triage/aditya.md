# 2016/2017 Research Preferences

NOTE: Take the time-frames for the ones in Yes with a pinch of salt, I don't have much of an idea about it

##Yes

###8 Month Project

- One Shot learning

- Serverless Products 

###4 Month Project

- Source/fact credibility ranking

- Interpretability (LIME, BRLs) and trust

- Dynamic vocabs in NLP (fasttext)

## Maybe

- Ambient Data-Viz (This could probably be the prototype rather than the topic, and there is some cool art for urban spaces that we could make) 

- Recommendation (I'm deeply interested in this but I want to be sure that the end product is technically cutting edge and product-wise interesting to play with)

- Anomaly detection (I suppose this would be valuable to financial institutions for detecting fraud)

- Conversational/AI bots (Always an interesting topic but how can we add value here?)

- Differential privacy/overfitting and private data --- synthetic data generation

- Time series/forecasting --- Gaussian processes

## No opinion 

- Causal models and reasoning

- Semi-supervised/adversarial learning --- embedding and autoencoders

- Reinforcement learning
 
- Intuitive psychology/theory of mind (RL for coffee)
 
- Automatic theorem proving/program correctness --- property-based code testing

- Neuromorphic computing --- FPGAs

- Automatic ML/parameter optimization

- Provenance/reproducibility of data analysis

- Source code repository analysis/sparse pointer models
