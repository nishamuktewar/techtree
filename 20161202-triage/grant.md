I don't feel informed enough to comment on each one, but here are the ones I have an opinion on.

YES

4-Month
- Interpretability (LIME, BRLs) and trust: I think this is an interesting topic that will get more and more relevant. Not totally sure on what the prototype looks like, though.

8-Month
- Dynamic vocabs in NLP (fasttext): I think this has some interesting prototype possibilities. I also feel like I have more of an understanding of it based on past reports (that could mean we're nicely building on stuff or it could mean we should branch out with something more different than this).
- Conversational AI/bots --- question answering: I would be more interested in focusing on question answering than going deep into the bot game but I think that could make for a cool prototype.

MAYBE

4-Month
- Serverless products: I like this topic but all the talk about it I have seen from javascript people is about how it can scale well and cost less – both things which I think it would be hard to make a compelling prototype about. There may be other advantages (data science ones?) I don't understand though.
- Differential privacy/overfitting and private data --- synthetic data
  generation: I think I get why this is interesting but I have a hard time imagining the prototype.
- Provenance/reproducibility of data analysis

8-Month
- Recommendation
- Semi-supervised/adversarial learning --- embedding and autoencoders
- Reinforcement learning

For these three I have some idea of what a prototype could look like. I think we could make any of them work so I defer to what is most exciting/relevant tech-wise.

NO OPION

- Causal models and reasoning
- One shot learning
- Intuitive psychology/theory of mind (RL for coffee)
- Automatic theorem proving/program correctness --- property-based code testing
- Neuromorphic computing --- FPGAs
- Automatic ML/parameter optimization
- Source/fact credibility ranking --- fact-checking plugin
- Anomaly detection
- Source code repository analysis/sparse pointer models
