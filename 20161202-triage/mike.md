## Maybe

Exciting but less sure about the report

- Reinforcement learning
- FPGAs
- Time series/forecasting --- Gaussian processes
- One shot learning
- Recommendation
- Source/fact credibility ranking --- fact-checking plugin

Not exciting to me but would probably be an OK report

- Automatic ML/parameter optimization

## No

Too theoretical/abstract or too soon

- Automatic theorem proving/program correctness --- property-based code testing
- Causal models and reasoning
- Neuromorphic computing
- Intuitive psychology/theory of mind (RL for coffee)

Too specific

- Source code repository analysis/sparse pointer models
- Differential privacy/overfitting and private data --- synthetic data
  generation

Too late

- Conversational AI/bots
