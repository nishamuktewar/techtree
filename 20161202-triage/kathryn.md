My top choices are:

4 months = interpretability. This comes up all the time in finacial services and healthcare. Seems like a topic we can address in 4 months. Trust also on minds with autonomous vehicles/machines ( which we can leverage for marketing...).

8 months = automated ML/parameter optimization. Seems like a big deal for the future of the data science community. Fits our thesis regarding commoditization of tooling and larger impact on businesses - how they hire - how they think about the future.
