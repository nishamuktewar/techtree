1. interpretability. Top choice. This comes up all the time in finacial services and healthcare. Seems like a topic we can address in 4 months. Trust also on minds with autonomous vehicles/machines ( which we can leverage for marketing...).
2. Source/fact credibility ranking. Second choice. Hot topic to do right now in the wake of the election and moral news crisis.

1. Automated ML/parameter optimization. First choice. Seems like a big deal for the future of the data science community. Fits our thesis regarding commoditization of tooling and larger impact on businesses - how they hire - how they think about the future.
2. Differential privacy. Second choice. Important topic that has a lot of relevance in business and allows us to have something for those needs.

Concerns:

Adverserial learning: Not convinced this is useful/practical/interesting for people outside data science. Hard to market and sell. I have watched non-technical people grill academics on this topic by saying it only seems to make sense in image analysis. 

Chatbot: We should commercialize this through the mini report and not a full research process.
