# Design/Visualization/Front-End Interesting List

This document is an effort to get a little more organized about things we want to explore dealing with design, visualization and front-end dev. Primarily for the benefit of the prototype/visualization interns.

#### Data Sources Note

Our design and visualization work is generally less modular then our engineering research because it requires a data-source or other back-end engineering work to get started. For that reason, I'm making an effort to think about and note the back-end requirements for the projects listed.
