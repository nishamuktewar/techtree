# Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Inference

Tutorial Description on Variational Inference by David Blei, Shakir Mohamed, and
Rajesh Raganath (https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=6199). The
slides are here
(http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/talks/2016_NIPS_VI_tutorial.pdf) and
containt nice examples which may help us as we communicate the content we
developed to clients. For research, part IV "Beyond the Mean
Field" is relevant. It presents a number of approaches to approximate more
complex posterior distributions than we cover in our report. Here is a summary
of the proposed approaches:
